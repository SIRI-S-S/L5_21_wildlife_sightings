\## Issues Identified and Fixed



| No. | Tool | Issue Identified | Explanation | Fix Applied |

|---:|---|---|---|---|

| 1 | Bandit | Possible SQL Injection | The SQL query was created using string formatting, which could allow unsafe input to affect the query. | Replaced string formatting with parameterized SQL queries using `?` placeholders. |

| 2 | Bandit | Weak MD5 Hash | MD5 is considered weak for security-sensitive hashing. | Replaced MD5 with SHA-256 to generate the observer identifier. |

| 3 | Bandit | Use of `assert` | Assertions can be removed when Python runs in optimized mode, so they should not be used for essential runtime checks. | Replaced `assert` with an explicit `if` condition and `RuntimeError`. |

| 4 | Pylint | Mutable Default Argument | Using `{}` as a default argument can cause the same dictionary to be shared between function calls. | Changed the default to `None` and initialized a new dictionary inside the function. |

| 5 | Pylint | Missing Docstrings | The module and functions did not explain their purpose. | Added module and function docstrings. |

| 6 | Pylint | Incorrect Naming Style | Function names used camelCase instead of the recommended Python `snake\_case` style. | Renamed functions, such as `logSighting` to `log\_sighting` and `observerId` to `observer\_id`. |

| 7 | Pylint / Flake8 | Long Lines and Formatting Issues | Some lines exceeded the recommended length, and the code contained spacing and naming-style violations. | Split long statements across multiple lines and corrected spacing and variable names. |

| 8 | Pylint | Unnecessary `else` After `return` | The `else` block was unnecessary because the `if` branch already returned a value. | Removed `else` and returned the value directly. |

| 9 | Pylint | Missing Empty-Result Handling | The `rarest()` function could fail if the database contained no sightings. | Added a check that returns `"Unknown"` when no records are available. |



\## Verification Results



| Tool | Before Fixes | After Fixes | Result |

|---|---|---|---|

| Pylint | 3.46/10 | 10.00/10 | Target above 9.5 achieved |

| Bandit | 1 high, 1 medium, 1 low severity finding | No issues identified | Findings addressed |

| Flake8 | 6 reported violations | No reported violations | Formatting checks passed |



\*\*Conclusion:\*\* Static code analysis helped identify security risks, code-quality problems, and formatting violations. After applying fixes, the program achieved a Pylint score of 10/10, with no issues reported by Bandit or Flake8.
